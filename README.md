![MongoDB Stitch Slack App Flow Example](https://github.com/mrlynn/mongodb-stitch-slack-urlstash/blob/master/images/slack-mongodb-stitch.png?raw=true "MongoDB Stitch Slack App Flow Diagram") 

Slack is not only the fastest growing startup in history, it’s app by the same name is one of those popular communication tools in use today. We use it extensively at MongoDB to foster efficient communications between teams and across the company. We’re not alone. It seems like every developer I encounter uses it in their company as well. 

One incredibly cool thing about Slack (and there are many) is its extensibility. Writing a slash command, or a standalone bot app is incredibly easy but when you combine the power of MongoDB, and specifically MongoDB Stitch’s backend as a service, the combination enables you to build an incredibly powerful chatbot in minutes. Let’s create a Slack App that stores and retrieves interesting URLs. We’ll call this app URL Stash.

In this repository, we'll provide the source code for a MongoDB Stitch service function that handles integration with a MongoDB Database from a Slack slash command. For this simple example, we'll accept URLs from a slash command and store them in a MongoDB Database using a MongoDB Stitch service.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
